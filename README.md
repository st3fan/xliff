Work in progress.

This is a tiny package to parse `.xliff` files.

It is currently used in the following two projects:

* In [Firefox Focus](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus) to import strings from the Mozilla L10N Repository into the Focus Xcode project.
* In [XLIFF Tool](https://github.com/st3fan/xlifftool), a generic XLIFF tool that will hopefully replace a number of specialized scripts that we use for [Firefox for iOS](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios) and [Firefox Focus for iOS](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus).

> Please [file a bug](https://github.com/st3fan/xliff/issues/new) if you have some specific wish or requirement.
